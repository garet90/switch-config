# Switch Config
I was tired of having to configure these switches with dumb command line tools, so I wrote this.
See L3 routing examples in examples/L3.yaml, or L2 in examples/L2.yaml.
If you want, you can add a generator for your own switch type in generators/.
I might add more NOS in the future if I try them out.
